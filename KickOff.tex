\section{Kick-Off}
For our project kick-off we decided to go to Reffen and contact our potential customers and, of course, have some very nice food, see figure \ref{kick-offpic}. In general, there was a very optimistic attitude towards the project among the vendors. Several of them mentioned that the vendors at Reffen do not yet participate in any market platform as they will not tolerate a fee on transactions completed through third-party platforms.

\subsection{Interviews}
During the kick-off event we had a very nice time, ate some very good food, and met some interesting people. In the following section we will briefly report on two of the interviews we conducted during our kick-off event.

\subsection{Søren from Fresheet}
We met with Søren, of CPH Foodtech Community and founder of Fresheet.co, in his futuristic container at “Reffen GREENS”. Søren is growing “microgreens” with hydroponics and Arduino boards, which he then sells to the vendors at Reffen. Søren really liked our idea and is available for questions if we need it. He has very good connections to the vendors at Reffen and has also started several companies himself. We got Søren's email and contact info.

\subsection{Oscar from Baobab}
Baobab offers exotic African food with signature dishes including fruit from the Baobab tree which, interestingly enough, begins to hollow out itself when it reaches its first millenia, according to Oscar, the owner. Oscar mentioned that there is a strong opposition to services that put a fee on transactions (e.g. JustEat) which is why the Reffen community has not yet subscribed to these services. When we mentioned that the app would be a “flat subscription” with no fee on transactions, Oscar seemed very positive towards the project and recommended us to contact him when we have a prototype for the app.
