\subsection{ Team Guidelines}

\subsubsection{Meetings}
We have the following times reserved for meetings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tuesdays 1200-1230 Supervision
    \item Tuesdays 1230-1400 Weekly SCRUM meeting
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Workload}

The team will be subdivided into smaller groups of 2-3 people. We will then use the Tuesday meetings to coordinate and distribute the workload to subgroups for the following week. On Monday evenings, every group will upload their work to Google Drive or the repository.

\subsubsection{Handling Issues}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If there is a disagreement, we shall communicate with each other in a respectful manner.
    \item If a group member needs help, they shall ask the other members for help.
    \item Constructive feedback is encouraged.
    \item When editing other’s work, a suggestion comment shall first be made before any modifications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools We Use}
During the project, we have used various tools. In this section we will briefly describe those tools.

\subsubsection{ \LaTeX }
We use \LaTeX  for typesetting our final portfolio. We agree with the following guidelines when typesetting \LaTeX :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can use the enumerate, itemize, figures and tables environments - nothing else, except (sub)sections.
    \item All external references must be included in "references.bib" and called in \LaTeX   with the \verb "\cite[p.123]{ID}" command.
    \item Figures from external resources must be referenced with "cite" in the figure caption.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{ Github }

We use Github for storing all our files in a common repository. Git is a version control system and has many advantages with regards to workflow. Our Github repository can be found at \url{https://github.itu.dk/renha/strEAT}

\subsubsection{ Trello }
We use Trello for managing all tasks to be completed. Each task is put on the Trello board together with the people responsible and deadlines. Our Trello board can be found at \url{https://trello.com/b/yVBXG3Ek/strEAT}

\subsubsection{ Slack }
Slack is the primary communication channel for our team. All important announcements \emph{must} go through Slack. We also encourage team members to use Slack when communicationg about subtasks. Our Slack workspace can be found at \url{https://strEAT.group.slack.com/}
